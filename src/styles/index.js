import styled from 'styled-components';

// EXAMPLE
/*
export const MyStyle = styled.div`
  // STYLES HERE

IMPORT NON-DEFAULT EXPORT INTO OTHER FILES THIS WAY:
  import { MyStyle } from './styles'; // BECAUSE THE FILE IS NAMED index, WE DON'T NEED TO INCLUDE THE FILE NAME IN THE PATH, BECAUSE THE index FILE WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE INCLUDED . . .
